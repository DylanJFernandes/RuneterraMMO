After playing all of Riots Games, reading all of their lore, and watching their Tv show Arcane. We fell in love with the universe of Runeterra so with our expertise of 6+ years of Game Development we decided to give our own take of a Riot MMO. 

  In this project we bring League Of Legends to life starting with the signature cities Piltover and Zaun. In these cities you choose your path and grind out missions all to better your character and their specific abilites.

  A little about us, born and raised in SoCal we have loved games since we were children. This fostered a hunger for game development which blossomed into us using unreal engine and primarly C++ to bring our creations to life. Which lead to contract work shipping titles and leading teams. We prioritze using AAA software such as Zbrush, Maya, Marmoset, 3D Coat, PhotoShop, Blender, Docker, AWS.
  
  We hold ourselves and our work to the highest standard making sure all of our code is bullet proof through constant unit tests and in game testing.
